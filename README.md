# Instant Search+ 1.0.0
Instant Search for Zen Cart, based on [Instant Search](https://github.com/torvista/InstantSearch) plugin.

Tested on Zen Cart 1.5.7c (responsive classic template), PHP 7.3/7.4.

* Replaces `searches.php` with an AJAX class
* Searches into the product name and the product model
* Better, per-word search
* Better sorting logic of the results
* Displays the product image, name and model on the result

## TODO
* Search also within categories and manufacturers
* Admin configuration (e.g. enable/disable, max # of results, which fields to search, which fields to show (e.g. price))
