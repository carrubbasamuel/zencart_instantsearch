# Instant Search plugin 3.0 for Zen Cart 1.5.7 and 1.5.8
Show autocomplete search results while the user is typing. Show relevant search results in a listing page with 
infinite scroll.

# Features
This plugin uses a combination of MySQL Full-Text Search and LIKE/REGEXP queries to quickly find and sort products, brands, and categories based on their relevance to the user query.

The results can be displayed in an autocomplete dropdown as the user types in a search box and/or as a search results page with a sortable product list and infinite scroll once the user submits the search form, providing an alternative to the classic Zen Cart search results page.

Version 3.0 of the plugin brings new features and substantial improvements to previous versions.
- Faster and better searches, with MySQL Full-Text search and Query Expansion
- New, additional search results page with sortable product list and infinite scroll
- New admin settings, including control of which fields to search and their order
- More robust dropdown auto-positioning
- Support for Zen Cart 1.5.8 language files and plugin upgrade functionality
- Integration with Search Log plugin
- Responsive Classic and Bootstrap template files included
- Code almost entirely rewritten, removed jQuery dependency, and many other improvements
- No modifications to Zen Cart core files
- More features coming in the next versions!
